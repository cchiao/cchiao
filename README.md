### Hi!


My name is Christa (she/her). You can find my abbreviated cv [here](https://read.cv/christa) but you'll _more likely_ find me riding my bike around Rock Creek Park.


🏋️‍♀️ I'm currently:
- working on an analytics team!
- committing to doing a triathlon (next year) with [DC Tri Club](https://www.dctriclub.org/)


🌱 I'm currently learning:
- how to play the mandolin (using [MandoLessons](https://www.mandolessons.com/)!)
- about Amtrak credit card options.
- from the very best on data science, surveys, and programmatic application


🚲 I'm looking for leads on:
- your favorite bike routes in Washington D.C.
  


☎️ Contact: You can find me at first name dot last name at gmail
