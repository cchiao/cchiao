Hi there! 👋


My name is Christa (she/her) and I am a data scientist and manager of data teams working for Progressive candidates and causes. I currently live in New York City and am a full-time student at Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in Social Science Masters program and working part-time in data science roles. You can find my abbreviated cv [here](https://read.cv/christa) but you'll _more likely_ find me riding my bike around Central Park.


🏋️‍♀️ I'm currently working on:
- getting my Masters degree
- helping progressive organizations with data infrastructure, science, analysis, visualization
- my thesis


🌱 I'm currently learning:
- how to run, analyze, and improve field experiments
- machine learning
- how to build beautiful data viz
- how to play the mandolin (using [MandoLessons](https://www.mandolessons.com/))


🚲 I'm looking for leads on:
- projects and positions that will help Democrats win in 2022
- great biking routes in New York or Washington D.C. that are public-transportation accessible
- volunteer (or contract!) work with transportation infrastructure



☎️ Contact: You can find me at first name dot last name at gmail
