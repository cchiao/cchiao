### Hi!


My name is Christa (she/her). You can find my abbreviated resume [here](https://read.cv/christa) but you'll _more likely_ find me doing laps at the local pool or riding my bike around Rock Creek Park.


🏋️‍♀️ I'm currently:
- fighting seasonal allergies
- working on a part time analytics contracting project
- looking for full time work in the progressive data & analytics space
- training for a triathlon with [DC Tri Club](https://www.dctriclub.org/)


🌱 I'm currently learning:
- how to play the mandolin (using [MandoLessons](https://www.mandolessons.com/)!)
- all of the different ways to do [visible mending](https://www.reddit.com/r/Visiblemending/)
- from the very best on data science, surveys, and programmatic application


🚲 I'm looking for leads on:
- your favorite bike routes in Washington D.C.
