### Hi!


My name is Christa (she/her) and I am a data scientist and manager of data teams working for Progressive candidates and causes. I currently live in Washington, DC working full-time in a data science role. You can find my abbreviated cv [here](https://read.cv/christa) but you'll _more likely_ find me riding my bike around Rock Creek Park.


🏋️‍♀️ I'm currently working on:
- analytics contracting


🌱 I'm currently learning:
- from the best on conducting surveys
- how to build extensible and stable data engineering pipelines
- how to play the mandolin (using [MandoLessons](https://www.mandolessons.com/)!)


🚲 I'm looking for leads on:
- your favorite bike routes in Washington D.C.
- volunteer (or contract!) work with transportation infrastructure



☎️ Contact: You can find me at first name dot last name at gmail
